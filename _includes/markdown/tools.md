## Introduction

In most instances, to tools for development are decided by the developer. DCC has a few preferences, but at this point, none of these are deal breakers.

<h2 id="git">Version Control{% include toplink.html %}</h2>

We use git for version control. Each project should have a repo on the DCC Github account. Exceptions should be discussed in advance.

### Branches

When multiple developers are working on the same project, its important that each developer works on their own branch of the project. The lead developer should act as the Merge Manager to accept pull requests from the other developers on the project.

<h2 id="task-runners">Task Runners{% include toplink.html %}</h2>

We are currently switching to Gulp. The Gulpfile for a project should be included in the repo.
