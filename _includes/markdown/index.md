Welcome to the DCC Marketing Best Practices site. This is meant to document our current practices and will be updated to reflect new processes and best practices. We are providing this documentation in an effort to make all our projects, developed internally and externally, consistent for training, maintainability, and usability; in addition to easing the on-boarding process for internal developers.

Our jobs as marketers is to stimulate demand for a business. Providing their clients the best possible user experience provides one avenue for stimulating demand. While some things documented here are opinions and can be debated, many things are published, established standards proven through user testing and time to provide the best possible user experience.

When it comes to coding standards, we follow the [WordPress Core Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/). They represent a wide variety of good practices established over years of managing the WordPress open source project. Since the purpose of this documentation is to standardize practices for multiple developers, borrowing from best practices established by some of the best developers in the world seems like a good place to start. We use these same standards for just about any project, as many of these practices are not WordPress-specific.
