## Introduction

While many developers have never run across a project actually requiring translatable content, we have several client with a multi-lingual audience. We have found its simpler to make every project translatable up-front than it is to convert projects after-the-fact. Thankfully, WordPress make this process simple, its just a matter of establishing and maintaining the habit of writing themes and plugins in a way that allows for translation.


## WordPress Functions {% assign anchor="functions" %}{% include toplink.html %}

WordPress has many easy-to-use functions for translating content. Familiarize yourself with them and their proper usage by reading through the Codex pages and some tutorials.


## Plugins vs Services {% assign anchor="comps" %}{% include toplink.html %}

There many plugins tat allow site administrators to translate or manage the translation of the site. In the past, we have used WPML and have licenses to use it. However, we have also found the limitations of WPML and decided to instead use a service that provides the translations as needed.
