## Introduction

Generally, if something can be written using vanilla Javascript, do it. The fewer dependencies, the better. That said, jQuery is typically already loaded for the front end of WordPress, so its fine to use that when its available. Try to limit additional libraries and requirements beyond the things already built into WordPress and even then, use them sparingly. While most of these libraries are really good and helpful, they also add yet-another-thing-to-load, which takes it toll on mobile and slower connections.
